\section{Architectural Strategies}
\label{sec:representation}

Each module will be programmed and packaged as a ROS2 package, except for the
controls module which will exist as firmware on the microcontroller. Even
though the microcontroller wonâ€™t be a ROS package, it will still have all the
characteristics of a ROS2 package; it will be entirely modular, using the same
communication system provided by ROS2. 
\par

The controls module will interface with actuators, sensors and thrusters. The
computer vision module will interface with cameras. All other modules will
exist as software and will go through the controls and computer vision modules
to interact with the environment. 
\par

Additionally, there will be a watchdog service that will monitor the liveliness
and diagnostics of the system.
